        Hey, my name is Hamze. I am trying to learn how to code in 30 days, and it is hard
        work but I think I can do it. This is my first practice website.</p>

        <p id= "introP"> This is me and my girlfriend. We are planning on going to a trip together through college and I want to learn this so I can support me and her! Learning how to code has been very hard, and self-motivation is actually the hardest part but I hope that I can do it! </p>
